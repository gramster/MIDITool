This is a MIDI Sequencer I wrote in 1991 for the Roland MPU-IPC (MPU-401)
MIDI card. I was sharing a house with a friend who had a small recording
studio and he got one to play with and I had a lot of fun coding this up.
It uses a text mode windowing library called D-Flat that came from a
series of articles by Al Stevens in Dr Dobbs.
