; Get a more recent version of the helpfile to fill in things
; that Steven's hasn't done yet.
;
; This is the help text file for the MIDITOOL application. It 
; includes the help text that a D-Flat application would use 
; for the user interface.
;
; There can be a help window with a helptag name for each
; command in commands.h, each menu label on the menu bar 
; as defined in menus.c, and each dialog box name in dialogs.c
;
; There can be other help windows as well. Some of them will
; be displayed as the result of hypertext and definition key 
; words embedded in the help text of other help windows. Others
; can be implemented from within an application software system.
;
; Following is the format for a help window:
;
; ÚÄÄ (1st column of each line)
; 
; ; anything with a semicolon in the 1st column is a comment
; <helptag>                 (names the help window)
; [<<]<helptag>             (names the previous window in chain)
; [>>]<helptag>             (names the next window in chain)
; Help Window Title         (displays in window's title bar)
; Help text follows until next helptag occurs
; Hypertext reference  [..keyword]<helptag> embedded in text
; Definition reference [**keyword]<helptag> embedded in text
; <helptag>                 (names another window)
;
; Notes: 
;   1. A hypertext reference, when selected, causes the 
;      associated help window named by the <helptag> to 
;      become the active help window.
;   2. A definition reference, when selected, displays
;      a momentary window with the text of the associated
;      help window named by the <helptag>. The window 
;      closes when the user releases the Enter key or
;      mouse button.
;   3. A definition window has no title.
;   4. The last window is followed by the <end> helptag.
;   5. The window's height and width adjust to the text.
;   6. The [..], [**], and <helptags> do not display and
;      do not figure in the width of the line in which 
;      they occur.

<Application>
[<<]<MIDITOOL>
[>>]<Menubar>
Application Window
The application window is MIDITOOL's `desktop'.

This window contains MIDITOOL's [..Editing Windows]<docwindow>
for editing tracks. Before you load or record
any tracks, the application window is empty.

The application window has an [..Action Bar]<Menubar>
just below its [..Title Bar]<titlebar> and a [..Status Bar]<statusbar>
at the bottom.
; -----------------------------------------
<MIDITOOL>
[>>]<Application>
The MIDITOOL Program
MIDITOOL is a simple but versatile tool for exploring MIDI
with the Roland MPU-401 MIDI Processing Unit. It allows you to
record, edit and play back multi-track MIDI information using up
to sixteen MIDI instruments arranged using the eight tracks of
the MPU.

Recorded MIDI information is stored in either a [..textual form]<TextFormat>
or a [..graphical form]<GrafikFormat>. You can use the built-in
editor to modify the information, or save it in a file to edit
with your own favourite editor. Although MIDITOOL does not sport
sophisticated editing facilities, the simple formats used for the
MIDI data allow easy editing with a text editor; thus, MIDITOOL
is very versatile.
; -----------------------------------------
<docwindow>
Window
A Window contains the MIDI data that you work
on. It displays within the [..Application Window]<Application>
and consists of these parts:

  [..Client Area]<client>
  [..Border]<border>
  [..Title Bar]<titlebar>
  [..Status Bar]<statusbar>
  [..Scroll Bars]<scrollbar>
  [..Control Box]<controlbox>
  [..Minimize Box]<minbox>
  [..Maximize Box]<maxbox>
  [..Restore Box]<restorebox>
  [..Resize Box]<sizebox>

There are two types of window used in MIDITOOL - 
a [..graphic window]<GrafikWindow> and a [..text window]<TextWindow>.
The text window is always open, but the graphic
window only opens when you select [..Graphic Editor]<ID_GRAFIK>
from the [..Edit menu]<ID_EDIT>.
; -----------------------------------------
<client>
[<<]<docwindow>

Client Area
The Client Area is the space inside the window's
borders where the MIDI data values are
displayed and manipulated.
; -----------------------------------------
<border>
[<<]<client>
[>>]<titlebar>
Border
The Border is the frame around a window. When the
window has the [**focus]<Focus>, the border is a double line.
When a different window has the focus, the border
is a single line.

The window's [..Scroll Bars]<scrollbar>, if any, are positioned
in the right and bottom parts of the border.
; -----------------------------------------
<titlebar>
[<<]<border>
[>>]<statusbar>
Title Bar
The Title Bar is at the top of the window and 
contains the window's title. When the window

Scroll Bars
You use Scroll Bars to scroll a window's data with the
mouse. A window can have one or two Scroll Bars - one
at the right and one at the bottom parts of the
window's Border. The Scroll Bar at the right scrolls
the document's data up and down.  The Scroll Bar on
the bottom scrolls the window's data right and left.

To scroll a window a line at a time, click the arrow
tokens at either end of the Scroll Bar. The Scroll Bar
includes a slider box that indicates the relative
position of the window's display with respect to the
total data. You can page to an approximate position
within the data by clicking inside the Scroll Bar.
You can [**drag]<Drag> the slider box in either direction to
scroll the data.

Restore Box
The Restore Box is the  token character at the right
end of a minimized window's [..Title Bar]<titlebar> and the  token
character at the right end of a maximized window's
Title Bar. You click the Restore Box to restore the
window to the position and size it had before it was
minimized or maximized.
; -----------------------------------------
<sizebox>
[<<]<restorebox>
Resize Box
The Resize Box is the lower right corner of the

; -----------------------------------------
;
;  Following are menu command help windows
;
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_ALLNEW>
[<<]<File>
[>>]<ID_NEW>
The Clear All Tracks Command
This command clears the data associated with all tracks. You will
then have to record new data or load new data from a file for each
track.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_NEW>
[<<]<ALLNEW>
[>>]<ID_OPEN>
The New Command
This command opens a new, untitled data window for the
[..active track]<ActiveTrack>. An untitled window is one that has not
been given a file name. When you use the [..Save]<ID_SAVE> or
[..Save as]<ID_SAVEAS> command on the File menu you will be asked
for a file name. If data is already loaded for the active
track, it is first erased.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_OPEN>
[<<]<ID_NEW>
[>>]<ID_SAVE>
The Open Command
This command opens an existing track data file and loads
it into the [..text window]<TextWindow>. You select the file by filling
in the [..File Open]<FileOpen> dialog box. The loaded data is
associated with the [..active track]<ActiveTrack>.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_SAVE>
[<<]<ID_OPEN>
[>>]<ID_SAVEAS>
The Save Command
This command saves the data associated with the
[..active track]<ActiveTrack> into a disk file. The file name is
the same as when the file was loaded. If the window
contains untitled data, this command works just like
the [..Save as]<ID_SAVEAS> command.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_SAVEAS>
[<<]<ID_SAVE>
[>>]<ID_PRINT>
The Save As Command
This command allows you to save the data associated
with the [..active track]<ActiveTrack> using a new file name. You
specify the file's name by filling in the fields on
the [..Save as]<SaveAs> dialog box. 

If the graphic window is active, the data will be
saved in graphical form. This could result in velocity
and other information being lost.

The new file name becomes the title of the data
associated with the [..active track]<ActiveTrack>.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_PRINT>
[<<]<ID_SAVEAS>
[>>]<ID_DOS>
The Print Command
This command prints the data in the
window that has the [**focus]<Focus>.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_DOS>
[<<]<ID_PRINT>
[>>]<ID_EXIT>
The DOS Command
This command "shells" out to DOS. You return to the
application from DOS by executing the DOS exit
command at the DOS command line. 
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_EXIT>
[<<]<ID_DOS>
The Exit Command
This command exits to DOS from the application.
If you have changed the data associated with the 
[..active track]<ActiveTrack>, the program will ask if you want
to save it and allow you to do so.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_UNDO>
[<<]<Edit>
[>>]<ID_CUT>
The Undo Command
This command "undoes" the most recent [..Delete]<ID_DELETETEXT> or
[..Clear]<ID_CLEAR> command. The text that was deleted by one
of these commands is written into the data at 
the current cursor location.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_CUT>
[<<]<ID_UNDO>
[>>]<ID_COPY>
The Cut Command
This command is active only when the current window 
has a [..marked block]<Block>. The command deletes the text in
the marked block, copies it to the [..Clipboard]<Clipboard>, and
closes up the space in the data that the text 
previously occupied.
; ----------------------------------------- 
<ID_COPY>
[<<]<ID_CUT>
[>>]<ID_PASTE>
The Copy Command
This command is active only when the current window
has a [..marked block]<Block>. The command copies the text in 
the marked block to the [..Clipboard]<Clipboard>, and closes up
the space in the data  that the text previously
occupied.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_PASTE>
[<<]<ID_COPY>
[>>]<ID_CLEAR>
The Paste Command
This command is active only when the [..Clipboard]<Clipboard>
contains text. The command inserts the text from
the Clipboard into the currently active data
window at the current cursor location.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_CLEAR>
[<<]<ID_PASTE>
[>>]<ID_DELETETEXT>
The Clear Command
This command is active only when the current window
has a [..marked block]<Block>. The command deletes the block
of text, leaving empty space in the data where the 
text had been.

You can undo the text deletion with the [..Undo]<ID_UNDO>
command.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_DELETETEXT>
[<<]<ID_CLEAR>
[>>]<ID_TIMESNAP>
The Delete Command
This command is active only when the current window 
has a [..marked block]<Block>. The command deletes the block
of text, closing the space in the data where the
text had been.

You can undo the text deletion with the [..Undo]<ID_UNDO>
command.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_TIMESNAP>
[<<]<ID_DELETETEXT>
[>>]<ID_GRAFIK>
The Time Snap Command
This command modifies the data associated with the 
[..active track]<ActiveTrack> so that every tick count byte is
a multiple of the [..time snap value]<TimeSnapValue>. This allows
you to get note changes to occur on precise beat
intervals. Two beats correspond to 240 ticks, so to
snap data to quarter note intervals in 4/4 time you
would use a time snap value of 120, for example.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_GRAFIK>
[<<]<ID_TIMESNAP>
The Graphic Editor Command
This command opens a second text editing window in 
which the MIDI data is represented graphically. Only
Note On/Note Off and MPU timing messages are used,
and velocity information is also lost. This 
[..graphical format]<GrafikFormat> is often easier to use than the 
[..text format]<TextFormat>.
 
If the MIDI data is saved to a file while this window 
is active, the data will be saved in the graphical
format. Changing the [..active track]<ActiveTrack> will cause the 
[..graphic window]<GrafikWindow> to close.

The graphical format can be displayed more concisely
by using [**repetitions]<Repetitions>.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_RECORD>
[<<]<Run>
[>>]<ID_PLAY>
The Record Command
This command causes the MIDI data associated with the 
[..active track]<ActiveTrack> to be cleared, and new data to be 
recorded from the device attached to the MPU's MIDI-IN
socket. Recording will continue until the right mouse
button is pressed.

If [..Flush Mode]<ID_FLUSH> is set, the data will be displayed in
the text window as it is recorded. This can lead to 
timing errors in the recorded data, however.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_PLAY>
[<<]<ID_RECORD>
[>>]<ID_PLAYALL>
The Play Command
This command plays the data associated with the active track back
through the MIDI-OUT socket of the MPU. You will be prompted to
select an instrument from a list of installed instruments, by
clicking on a [..Select Instrument]<ID_INST0> Radio Button. This list includes
the MIDI channel numbers associated with each instrument.

All the MIDI commands that were received from the input channel will
be modified to address the appropriate output channel on playback.
You can thus play the same data using any of the attached instruments.
If you select the [..Play As Recorded]<ID_NOREDIRECT> radio button, the MIDI data will
be played back without the channel information being modified.

If [..Flush Mode]<ID_FLUSH> is set, the data will be displayed in the text 
window as it is played, although this can lead to timing problems.

When you select an instrument for playback, that instrument becomes
the [..active instrument]<ActiveInst> for the [..active track]<ActiveTrack>. The
[..Play All]<ID_PLAYALL> command allows multiple tracks to be played
back.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_PLAYALL>
[<<]<ID_PLAY>
[>>]<ID_METRO>
The Play All Tracks Command
This command plays back all the track data currently loaded or
recorded. If a track has an [..active instrument]<ActiveInst>, the data for that
track will be modified to use that instrument; otherwise the data
for that track will be played unmodified.

If [..Flush Mode]<ID_FLUSH> is set, the data will be displayed in the text
window as it is played, although this can lead to timing problems.

The [..Play]<ID_PLAY> command allows a single track to be played.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_METRO>
[<<]<ID_PLAYALL>
The Metronome On/Off Command
This command toggles the MPU's built-in metronome on or 
off.

You can change the rate at which the metronome beats by
changing the [..Metronome Rate]<ID_METRATE> in the [..Change Configuration]<ChgCfgBox>
Dialog Box.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_SEARCH>
[<<]<Search>
[>>]<ID_REPLACE>
The Search Command
This command opens the [..Search Text]<SearchText>
Dialog Box to allow you to search
the text for a matching string.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_REPLACE>
[<<]<ID_SEARCH>
[>>]<ID_SEARCHNEXT>
The Replace Command
This command opens the [..Replace Text]<ReplaceText>
Dialog Box to allow you to search the
text for a matching string and replace
it with a different text string.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_SEARCHNEXT>
[<<]<ID_REPLACE>
The Next Command
This command continues the most recent [..Search]<ID_SEARCH>
command beginning at the current cursor position.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_CHANGECFG>
[<<]<Options>
[>>]<ID_DELINST>
The Change Configuration Commmand
This command pops up the [..Change Configuration]<ChgCfgBox>
Dialog Box, enabling you to modify MIDITOOL's
[**configuration]<Config>.
; -----------------------------------------
<ID_DELINST>
[<<]<ID_CHANGECFG>
[>>]<ID_ADDINST>
The Delete Instrument Command
This command allows you to delete an instrument from the current
[**configuration]<Config>. You will be prompted to select an instrument from
a list of installed instruments, by clicking on a [..Select Instrument]<ID_INST0>
